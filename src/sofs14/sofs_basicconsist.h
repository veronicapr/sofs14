 *
 *  \brief Set of operations to check the basic consistency of the file system SOFS11 internal data structures.
 *
 *         The aim is to provide a library with functionalities to check metadata consistency issues when the file
 *         system is in operation.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li get file system magic number
 *      \li quick check of the superblock metadata
 *      \li quick check of the table of inodes metadata
 *      \li quick check of the data zone metadata
 *      \li quick check of a free inode
 *      \li quick check of a free inode in the clean state
 *      \li quick check of a free inode in the dirty state
 *      \li quick check of an inode in use
 *      \li quick check of the allocation status of a data cluster
 *      \li quick check of the contents of a directory
 *      \li get error message.
 *
 *  \author Ant√≥nio Rui Borges - September 2010 / September 2011, Sepetember 2014
 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           or the local error that better represents the error cause. Local errors are out of the range of the
 *           system errors and their codes are listed bellow.
