 *  \brief Set of operations to manage data clusters: level 3 of the internal file system organization.
 *
 *         The aim is to provide an unique description of the functions that operate at this level.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li read a specific data cluster
 *      \li write to a specific data cluster
 *      \li handle a file data cluster
 *      \li free and clean all data clusters from the list of references starting at a given point.

 *  \author Ant√≥nio Rui Borges - September 2010 / September 2011, September 2014
 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           or the local error that better represents the error cause. Local errors are out of the range of the
 *           system errors.
