 *     \li <em>inode table metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in number of blocks, total number of inodes

 *         inodes form a double-linked list whose head and tail location are also provided (it may be seen as a dynamic
 *         FIFO that links together, using the inodes themselves as nodes, all the free inodes)
 *     \li <em>data zone metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in total number of data clusters, number of free
 *         data clusters and its three main reference components: the insertion and retrieval caches that provide an
 *         easy access temporary storage to references (static structures resident within the superblock itself) and
 *         the location of the head and the tail of the general repository of free data clusters double-linked list
 *         (dynamic FIFO that links together, using the data  clusters themselves as nodes, all the free data clusters
 *         whose references are not in the above mentioned caches).
