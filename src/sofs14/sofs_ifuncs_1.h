 *  \brief Set of operations to manage the double-linked lists of free inodes and free data clusters: level 1 of the
 *         internal file system organization.
 *
 *         The aim is to provide an unique description of the functions that operate at this level.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li allocate a free inode
 *      \li free the referenced inode
 *      \li allocate a free data cluster
 *      \li free the referenced data cluster.

 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           or the local error that better represents the error cause. Local errors are out of the range of the
 *           system errors.

 *  a parameter and generally initialized. It must be free and if is free in the dirty state, it has to be cleaned
 *  first.
 *
 *  Upon initialization, the new inode has:
 *     \li the field mode set to the given type, while the free flag and the permissions are reset
 *     \li the owner and group fields set to current userid and groupid
 *     \li the <em>prev</em> and <em>next</em> fields, pointers in the double-linked list of free inodes, change their
 *         meaning: they are replaced by the <em>time of last file modification</em> and <em>time of last file
 *         access</em> which are set to current time
 *     \li the reference fields set to NULL_CLUSTER
 *     \li all other fields reset.

 *  \param type the inode type (it must represent either a file, or a directory, or a symbolic link)

 *  \return -\c EDCINVAL, if the data cluster header is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EWGINODENB, if the <em>inode number</em> in the data cluster <tt>status</tt> field is different from the
 *                          provided <em>inode number</em>
 *  \return -\c ELIBBAD, if some kind of inconsistency was detected at some internal storage lower level
 *  \return -\c EBADF, if the device is not already opened
